// Definition
// Debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed.
//  It ensures that a function is only called after a certain delay
//  â€” and only if it hasn't been called again during that delay.

// Use Case
// Used to improve performance
// Window resize
// Search Input Suggestion
// Form field Validation
// Scroll events
